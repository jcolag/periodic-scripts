# Periodic Scripts

An archive of daily (or similar) scripts that John uses to maintain processes.

Currently, it contains the following.

 * **`diary.sh`**:  Creates the stub for a daily diary/journal entry that includes a varying "mental health check-in" question, a summary of morning activity, a table describing media consumption, food eaten, the rest of the day's activity, and space for any freeform thoughts.
 * **`editor.sh`**:  Determines and opens the default text editor without hanging the terminal.
 * **`night.sh`**:  Switches the system (Ubuntu, specifically) between light- and dark-modes, depending on the presence of a command-line parameter.

Normally, I'd write something here about how I appreciate contributions, as long as you act well towards other people.  However, in this case, I use these scripts on a daily basis for specific purposes, and so would expect anybody who finds them potentially useful to adapt them to their own ends, rather than create a universal version for everyone.

I'll *consider* suggestions, but if it would break my automated processes, then I'll almost certainly discard the suggestion.
